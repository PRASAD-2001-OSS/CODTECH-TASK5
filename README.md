# <ins>Project Name</ins> :- RECIPE FINDER APPLICATION

### Overview of the Code

This HTML code represents a **Recipe Finder** web application, designed to provide a user-friendly interface for browsing recipes. Here is a detailed breakdown:

---

#### **HTML Structure**

1. **Document Metadata**:
   - Declares the document type (`<!DOCTYPE html>`) and sets the language attribute to English (`lang="en"`).
   - Uses UTF-8 encoding and a viewport meta tag to enhance mobile responsiveness.
   - Sets the page title as "Recipe Finder" and links to an external CSS file (`style.css`) for styling.

2. **Body Content**:
   - **App Container (`#app`)**:
     - This main container wraps all application elements, providing a centralized structure for styling and scripting.
   
   - **Header**:
     - Contains a `header` section with the class `header`, enclosing all header content.
     - The `header-title` div displays:
       - An SVG icon of a chef's hat, providing a visual cue for the recipe theme.
       - A heading (`<h1>`) with the title "Recipe Finder."

   - **Main Content**:
     - The main section (`main`) contains two main divs:
       - `#search-filters`: A placeholder for search filter options where users can narrow down recipes based on certain criteria.
       - `#recipes-grid`: A grid to dynamically display recipe options based on user input.

   - **Modal Window**:
     - `#recipe-modal`: A hidden div with the class `modal`, likely intended to display detailed recipe information when a user selects a recipe from the grid.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - An external JavaScript file (`script.js`) is linked at the end of the body, which likely contains the interactivity and dynamic functionality for the Recipe Finder app.

#### **Key Features and Observations**

1. **Header Section**:
   - Displays a recipe-themed title and icon for clear branding.
   - Includes an SVG chef hat icon, adding a professional look and aligning with the cooking theme.

2. **Dynamic Content Areas**:
   - `#search-filters` and `#recipes-grid` provide placeholders for adding search functionality and displaying results, suggesting a structured, user-driven interface.
   
3. **Modal Element**:
   - The `#recipe-modal` is initially hidden (via the `hidden` class) and intended to display detailed information about a selected recipe, enhancing user experience by allowing easy access to detailed views without leaving the main page.
